# minimal-assembler

features:
- MOVZ
- MOVK 
- LDR 
- SVC 
- implemented PC relative addressing 
- symbol resoloution 
- literal pooling
- example asssembly file that works

can easily add more insturctions currently it parses more instructions than it encodes in case I want to go implement them later
